I did an internship at IMDEA Software under the supervision of Gilles Barthe and Benedikt Schimdt.
I implemented some tactics for their project: [EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt)

EasyCrypt is a toolset for reasoning about relational properties of
probabilistic computations with adversarial code. Its main application is the
construction and verification of game-based cryptographic proofs.

My task was to implement *ring* and *field* equation tactics plus the
implementation of a more automatic tactics like *optimistic sampling*.
