This a current project I am working at [Arbitration Games Proofs](https://gitlab.software.imdea.org/martin.ceresa/leanfpgames).

The idea is to design a language to have authenticated data structures plus
arbitration games in a single place.

Arbitration Games come from the world of Optimistic Rollups and a first idea is to replicate some of their work, but having formal proofs showing that:
+ Honest claim proposers can always defend their claims and win.
+ Honest challengers always win and losing claims are removed.
