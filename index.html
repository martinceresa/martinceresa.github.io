  <h2>Research</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    My interests include: theoretical computer science, programming languages
    theory, type theory, (a little bit of) category theory, mathematics and its
    foundations, topology and logic.  Recently I have found myself studying the
    history of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics.

  <p>
I am currently working on the application of formal methods to blockchain technologies in collaboration with Prof. César Sánchez.

  </header>
    <p>
    I did my PhD research at
    <a href="http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar">CIFASIS</a> under the guidance
    of <a href="http://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/">Dr.  Mauro Jaskelioff</a>.
    My thesis focused on Improvement Theory developed extensively
    by <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dave/Homepage_David_Sands/Home.html">Prof.
    Sands</a> early in the nineties. The main goal of my thesis was to develop
    an effectful improvement theory, i.e. an improvement theory for languages
    with algebraic effects.
    </p>

    <p>
    Until 2015, I was a student in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="http://web.fceia.unr.edu.ar">Universidad
    Nacional de Rosario</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In 2013, I did an intership at <a href="https://software.imdea.org">IMDEA
    Software Institute</a> (Madrid, Spain) under the supervision
    of <a href="http://beschmi.net/">Benedikt Schmidt</a>, in the development of
    automatic tactics in <a href="https://www.easycrypt.info/trac/">EasyCrypt</a>.
    In this internship I learned about Modern Cryptography Proofs, and a bit about
    tactic development. I developed an automatic tactic (or <b>megatactic</b>) which
    implemented a <b>classic</b> cryptography step called <b>optimistic
    sampling</b>.
