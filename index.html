  <p>
    My name is Martín Ceresa and I am me.
    I do several things and some represent me more than others:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Capoeira in Madrid (now angola) with
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/capoeiramadrid">Angoleros Sim Sinho Madrid</a> and <a href="http://www.capoeiraangolamadrid.es">GCALV</a> </li>
    <li>Capoeira in Rosario <a href="https://www.capoeirarosario.com/">Projete Liberdade Capoeira</a></li>
    <li>Meditate, Yoga and Breadth</li>
    <li>Praud cat dad</li>
    <li>Got a PhD</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Current Research</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    My interests include: theoretical computer science, programming languages
    theory, type theory, (a little bit of) category theory, mathematics and its
    foundations, topology and logic.  Recently I have found myself studying the
    history of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics.
    </p>
  <p>
    I am currently working on the application of formal methods, mainly runtime
    verification, different technologies in collaboration
    with <a href="https://software.imdea.org/~cesar/">Prof. César Sánchez</a>.
    One of the applications is blockchains where we are trying to characterize
    the interaction between smart contract and new strategies to scale
    blockchains, the so called layer 2 schemes.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are also developing a <b>non</b>-turing complete language for embedded systems.
    Designing embedded systems for critical system (satellites in this case) is
    hard and a very studied problem.
    Our proposal is to design a simple language, close to the current state of
    affairs, and verify small parts of it.
    Stay tuned, we are about to publish it :D.

  <p>
    During the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021, I did a internship
    at <a href="https://software.imdea.org">IMDEA Software Institute</a>
    collaborating with <a href="https://software.imdea.org/~cesar/">Prof. César
    Sánchez</a>.
    We studied the behaviour emerging from the interaction between smart
    contracts and how to formally specify and verify properties about smart
    contracts.
    We developed a <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> library called <a href="$multi$">Multi</a> to
    study the behaviour emerging from the interaction between smart-contracts.
    Happily, we did not conclude our work and I am still working with César.
  </p>

    <p>
    I did my PhD research at
    <a href="http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar">CIFASIS</a> under the guidance
    of <a href="http://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/">Dr.  Mauro Jaskelioff</a>.
    My thesis focused on Improvement Theory developed extensively
    by <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dave/Homepage_David_Sands/Home.html">Prof.
    Sands</a> early in the nineties. The main goal of my thesis was to develop
    an effectful improvement theory, i.e. an improvement theory for languages
    with algebraic effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      In collaboration with <a href="#">Gustavo Grieco</a>, <a href="https://people.kth.se/~buiras/">Pablo
      Buiras</a> and<a href="http://mista.me/">Agustin Mista</a>, we developed random
      generation test case tool based on <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> complex
      types, <a href="https://github.com/nick8325/quickcheck">QuickCheck</a> and how implementors define complex
      data structures in their libraries.
      My main contribution was to extend the initial code base developed by
      Pablo, and designing new strategies to automatic derive QuickCheck
      arbitrary classes, resulting a tool we
      called <a href="https://github.com/CIFASIS/megadeth">MegaDeTH</a> .
      The tool is
      called <a href="https://github.com/CIFASIS/QuickFuzz">QuickFuzz</a>, but
      sadly is not maintain anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
    Until 2015, I was a student in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="http://web.fceia.unr.edu.ar">Universidad
    Nacional de Rosario</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In 2013, I did an intership at <a href="https://software.imdea.org">IMDEA
    Software Institute</a> (Madrid, Spain) under the supervision
    of <a href="http://beschmi.net/">Benedikt Schmidt</a>, in the development of
    automatic tactics in <a href="https://www.easycrypt.info/trac/">EasyCrypt</a>.
    In this internship I learned about Modern Cryptography Proofs, and a bit about
    tactic development. I developed an automatic tactic (or <b>megatactic</b>) which
    implemented a <b>classic</b> cryptography step called <b>optimistic
    sampling</b>.
