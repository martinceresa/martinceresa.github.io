  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Fuzzing is a popular technique to find flaws in programs using invalid or erroneous inputs but not without its drawbacks. At one hand, mutational fuzzers require a set of valid inputs as a starting point, in which modifications are then introduced. On the other hand, generational fuzzing allows to synthesize somehow valid inputs according to a specification. Unfortunately, this requires to have a deep knowledge of the file formats under test to write specifications of them to guide the test case generation process.</p>
<p>In this paper we introduce an extended and improved version of QuickFuzz, a tool written in Haskell designed for testing unexpected inputs of common file formats on third-party software, taking advantage of off-the-self well known fuzzers.</p>
<p>Unlike other generational fuzzers, QuickFuzz does not require to write specifications for the file formats in question since it relies on existing file-format-handling libraries available on the Haskell code repository. It supports almost 40 different complex file-types including images, documents, source code and digital certificates.</p>
<p>In particular, we found QuickFuzz useful enough to discover many previously unknown vulnerabilities on real-world implementations of web browsers and image processing libraries among others.</p>
